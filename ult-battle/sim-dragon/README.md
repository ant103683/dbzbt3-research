# Sim Dragon Breakdown
## Introduction
**Sim Dragon** is the first gamemode in Ultimate Battle. It is a **simulator** of **Dragon Ball**, in the sense that it consists of training, exploring and fighting.

There are a total of 7 battles, and the player is given 10 days before each battle. Odd battles (1, 3, 5, 7) will have each of **Cell's forms** as the opponent (**1st Form**, **2nd Form**, **Perfect Form**, **Perfect**), while even battles will have a **random character** as the opponent.

## Random Characters

Instead, it checks if the Z-Items in question are unlocked. Otherwise, they are skipped.
